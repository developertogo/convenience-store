## A Convenience Store based of Ruby

This Ruby code simmulates a basic order transaction at a grocery store.

# Initial Task

The Product is described by the brand name, product name and the cost price. St. Bernard marks up the product price by 25% in Miami-Dade county, and 30% each in palm beach and Broward county. If they sold 100 of one product in each of the 3 counties, what is their total profit if the cost price of the product is $30. Implement using object-oriented design and principles.
